# Components (25)

The site's structural chrome (header, footer, skip link, cookie bar) plus every recurring content block found across a full pass over all 54 captured pages, plus a targeted sweep of the remaining pages for anything still missed: hero banners, alternating image/text rows, card and icon-tile grids, testimonials, a pull quote, CTA banners, the location finder and its directory/profile-card pages, the cost calculator, a recipe card, an app-store download block, a standalone photo block, two video embeds, and the blog templates.

- **Class**: the component's CSS class, ID, or HTML element if the markup doesn't give it a class
- **UX Title**: the descriptive name used throughout this inventory

## Notes

Component reconciliation only looks one level under `<main>` (see the root README's "Known limitations"), so none of the 21 editorial components above were auto-detected — they're identified by eye, from a full pass over all 54 captured pages (41 from the site's nav/footer graph, plus 13 pulled specifically for blog-article variety — see the site overview), plus a follow-up sweep of the remaining pages using measured DOM section boundaries rather than a visual skim, specifically looking for anything still missed. That sweep flagged 16 unlabeled sections across 6 pages; 15 turned out to be ordinary headingless prose paragraphs already covered by the existing vocabulary, and one was genuinely new (Full-Width Photo). Each `usedOn` list reflects a page actually inspected against that pattern; a handful of pages sharing an obviously identical template (the four `/actueel/leeftijd/*` filtered listings, the four individual location pages, several `/actueel/*` articles) were extended by template match rather than pixel-by-pixel re-verification of every one. Several components — Recipe Card, App Store Download Block, Calculator / Cost Estimator Form, Full-Width Photo, Location Directory List, and Pull Quote Block — surfaced only once each in this sample; the full ~400-article blog archive almost certainly holds more of some of these, and likely other formats not seen yet (interviews, quizzes). `hoe-ziet-een-dag-op-het-kinderdagverblijf-eruit` was originally filed under Blog Article Body by template match rather than direct inspection; a check against its actual DOM structure (no numbered headings, no "Lees ook" row) found it was really ten [Image + Text Split Block](image-text-split.md) rows used as a timeline, and it's been moved there — a reminder that a template-match guess still needs verifying, not just the components found by eye in the first place. No CMS-field write-ups yet — that's a further, deeper pass.
